# Lab 0 – Spring Boot JPA Practical Example

## Overview
This lab demonstrates the successful setup and execution of a Spring Boot application using Maven, Spring Data JPA, and MySQL. The project follows the required GitHub workflow, application configuration, database integration, and runtime verification steps.

---

## Repository Setup
- The repository was forked from the instructor’s original repository.
- The fork was renamed according to the required naming convention.
- All work was completed within the forked repository and pushed to GitHub using Git.

---

## Project Configuration
- The project is a Maven-based Spring Boot application.
- Dependencies include:
    - Spring Boot Web
    - Spring Data JPA
    - MySQL Connector
- Application configuration is managed using `application.properties`.

---

## Database Setup
- MySQL Server is installed and running locally.
- A database named `csd230` was created and used by the application.
- Spring Data JPA and Hibernate are configured to manage the database schema and data.

---

## Application Execution
- The application starts successfully without errors.
- The embedded Apache Tomcat server runs on port `8080`.
- JPA operations (table creation, inserts, and queries) execute successfully at startup.

---

## Browser Verification
- The application is accessible through a web browser at:
